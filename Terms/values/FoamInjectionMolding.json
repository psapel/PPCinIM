    "definition": "The primary objective in thermoplastic foam molding is to produce thick-walled injection molded parts with wall thicknesses greater than 4 mm. The essential aspects of TSG are: Avoidance of sink marks even with large wall thicknesses or large wall thickness jumps, weight reduction compared to compactly molded parts of the same volume, high flexural rigidity due to the possible large wall thicknesses.",
