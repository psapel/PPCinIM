    "definition": "Consists of the sizes by which the injection moulding machine is identified: these are clamping force in kN and the calculated injection piston (or screw) displacement in cm3 (related to an injection pressure of 1000 bars). In an horizontal clamping unit, the clamping force in kN is identified by a suffix H. In the case of a vertical clamping or injection unit, the corresponding numerical value is supplemented by a suffix V. Where there is injection into the separating plate, in the horizontal clamping and injection unit, suffix L is added to the numerical values. If two injection units are provided, the calculated displacement in cm3 of the second unit must be linked to the numerical value for the calculated displacement (stroke volume) in cm3 of the first injection unit by a stroke (/). Examples: 17800 H - 16170, 600 V -35/60",
